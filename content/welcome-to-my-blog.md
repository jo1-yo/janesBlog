# Welcome to My Personal Blog

Hello everyone, I'm Jane Zhang, an 18-year-old programming enthusiast, entrepreneur, rock/ice climbing enthusiast, and creative writer from Beijing, China. I created this blog to share my knowledge, life insights, and various interesting ideas.

## About Me

As a young person passionate about programming, I'm full of enthusiasm for technology and innovation. At the same time, I'm also deeply passionate about rock and ice climbing. These outdoor activities not only strengthen my body but also cultivate my courage and perseverance when facing challenges.

In terms of creative pursuits, I enjoy writing journals and fiction, recording the details of life and expressing my inner thoughts through words. This creative outlet helps me organize my thoughts and is also a way for me to relax.

## My Skills

As a tech enthusiast with entrepreneurial dreams, I've been cultivating the following key skills:

### 1. Core Technical Foundations

- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Understanding arrays, trees, graphs, hashing, sorting/searchingâ€”both for writing efficient code and for technical interviews/pitches.
- **System Design & Architecture**: Designing scalable, fault-tolerant back-end systems: microservices, message queues, databases (SQL/NoSQL), caching layers.
- **Full-Stack Development**: Building both client (React, Vue, or mobile frameworks) and server (Node.js, Go, Python) components, plus REST/GraphQL APIs.
- **DevOps & Infrastructure**: Automating CI/CD pipelines, containerizing with Docker/Kubernetes, provisioning and monitoring on AWS/GCP/Azure.

### 2. Product & UX Sense

- **User Research & Validation**: Conducting interviews, A/B tests, landing-page MVPs to validate ideas before building.
- **Wireframing & Prototyping**: Using tools like Figma or Sketch to rapidly translate concepts into clickable prototypes.
- **Usability & Accessibility**: Ensuring interfaces are intuitive and compliant with accessibility standards (WCAG).

### 3. Data & AI Literacy

- **Data Collection & Analytics**: Instrumenting usage tracking, setting up dashboards, interpreting metrics (activation, retention, LTV).
- **Machine Learning Basics**: Building simple models or integrating prebuilt APIs.
- **Data Privacy & Security**: Understanding compliance requirements, encryption techniques, secure handling of personal information.

### 4. Business & Strategy Acumen

- **Lean Startup Methodology**: Rapidly iterating through build-measure-learn cycles, minimizing waste, pivoting decisively.
- **Go-to-Market & Growth Hacking**: Crafting viral loops, SEO/SEM strategies, referral incentives, content marketing.
- **Financial Modeling & Unit Economics**: Building P&L projections, calculating CAC vs. LTV, runway planning.

### 5. Fundraising & Pitching

- **Pitch Deck Crafting**: Telling a compelling story: problem, solution, market size, traction, team, financials.
- **Investor Relations**: Networking effectively, negotiating term sheets, understanding cap tables and equity dilution.

### 6. Leadership & Team Building
