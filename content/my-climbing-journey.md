# My Rock Climbing Journey: Challenges and Growth

## First Encounter with Climbing

I first encountered rock climbing when I was 15 years old. A friend invited me to try it at a local indoor climbing gym. Initially, I went with just curiosity, not expecting that this experience would completely change my life.

During my first climb, I remember awkwardly grabbing the holds, my arms quickly fatiguing from the unfamiliar way of exertion. But when I finally reached the top, that sense of achievement made me fall in love with the sport immediately.

## Technical and Psychological Challenges

Rock climbing is not just a physical challenge but also a mental test. Facing height and difficulty, I learned how to control fear and how to stay calm under pressure. These skills have been useful not only in climbing but also in other aspects of learning and life.

As my technique improved, I began to learn more professional knowledge: different grip techniques, body center of gravity control, route planning, etc. Each climb is a problem-solving process, requiring a combination of strength, skill, and strategy.

## From Indoor to Outdoor

After practicing in indoor climbing gyms for a year, I started to try outdoor natural rock wall climbing. Compared to indoor artificial walls, natural rock faces are more unpredictable and require stronger adaptability and judgment.

I remember my first outdoor climbing experience was on a rock face in the outskirts of Beijing. Facing real rock, I felt unprecedented challenges and excitement. Although I only completed a few simple routes that day, this experience gave me a deeper understanding and love for climbing.

## Ice Climbing: A New Challenge

Last winter, I started to try ice climbing. Compared to rock climbing, ice climbing requires more specialized equipment and techniques. The instability of the ice surface and the low-temperature environment bring entirely new challenges.

During my first ice climbing experience, I was surprised by how to use ice axes and crampons, and how to find stable points on the constantly changing ice surface. This sport not only trained my technique but also improved my adaptability in extreme environments.

## Changes Brought by Climbing

Climbing has changed how I view challenges. In climbing, failure is normal, and persistence and continuous attempts are the keys to success. This mindset has helped me maintain patience and perseverance when learning programming and solving complex problems.

Additionally, climbing has allowed me to meet many like-minded friends. In the climbing community, people encourage each other and share experiences, creating an atmosphere that makes me feel warm and supported.

## Future Plans

In the future, I hope to challenge more classic climbing routes both domestically and internationally, improving my technical level. At the same time, I also plan to combine climbing with programming, developing some climbing-related applications to help more climbing enthusiasts.

Climbing has taught me persistence and courage when facing difficulties, which will be my lifelong treasure.
